# Redux, higher order components (HOCs), styled components and immutable.js class demo

In this class demo/tutorial we'll be going over the following items:

- Redux
- Higher order components (HOCs)
- Styled components
- Immutable.js

Immutable.js, Redux and Styled components are all highly used libraries in the React/Javascript ecosystem at the time of this demo (2020) and the pattern of higher order components in used widely in the Redux library along with many other companies codebases.

We'll be working off the branch `class-demo` because I've removed quite a bit of the code and added `TODOs` along the way so that during the zoom session everyone can code along with me. The master branch has been left alone and can be used as reference during or after the sesssion.

I'll also add some documentation/good reads that will hopefully help you all along with your journey in project 3 and beyond (after graduating the bootcamp).
